      Hi, I am Bindu Velivela. I am a PEGA Certified Senior System Achitect, I
      have 2 years of experience as a pega developer and after that I have also
      worked a Associate Consultant for a pega based application. I was always
      passionate about App Development so in order to pursue my passion I am now
      pursuing Mobile Application Development course at Georgian College.
      <br /><br />
      I have very basic knowledge on Web Design and Application Development. I
      have a little touch with HTML, CSS and Java Script

    <h2>My Favourite Mobile Application</h2>
    <p id="image1"><img src="Uber Logo.png" /></p>
    <p>
      Uber is always going to be one of those apps which needs to be installed
      no matter what. It has become a part of my everyday life either for
      booking a ride or ordering food online. Two aspects that amazes me about
      this app is their customer service and easy to use user interface. Even
      people who doesn't understand technology well can also navigate and book
      what they want from this app. Although there are many similar apps in the
      market Uber would always be the first priority.

    <h2>Looking Forward to</h2>
    <p>
      I was always interested in learning web development. During my bachelors
      even though I am from Electronics background my interest in web
      development led me to learn Advanced Java there I got a chance to learn
      HTML, Oracle, CSS and Javascript but as we all know they are just basics.
      So, I am looking forward to learn advanced Web Development with the
      necessary frameworks.
